PREREQUISITES
-------------
Points2Grid depends on external libraries to get the job done -

1) curl: Please install libcurl from http://curl.haxx.se/. Points2Grid has
been tested to work with version 7.20.0 of libcurl.

CONFIGURATION
-------------
Please adjust the MEM_LIMIT variable in the Interpolation.h file to reflect
the memory limitations of your system. As a rule of thumb, set the
MEM_LIMIT to be (available memory in bytes)/55. For jobs that generate
grids cells greater than the MEM_LIMIT, points2grid goes "out-of-core",
resulting in significantly worse performance.

COMPILATION
-----------

If you have installed libraries at non-standard locations, please set
your CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH environment variable to respectively point to the
parent directory of the include files and libraries of the installed software
pre-requisites. Multiple paths can be separated with the platform-specific path
delimiter.

Example (Unix, bash): export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/curl:/other/prefix

If you define CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH as a command line option to `cmake`, you need to
use the CMake list delimiter, i.e. a semicolon.

Example: cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/opt/curl;/other/prefix"

To compile points2grid, simply use the standard cmake procedures:

mkdir build # make a build folder
cd build
cmake .. [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/install/prefix"]
make
make install

The software has been confirmed to work with gcc3 and gcc4 on Linux, Solaris
and OSX, and with clang on OSX.
